# CSMA Simulator

A Python GUI application to simulate Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) Protocol of MAC Layer. The application enables understanding of the behavior of CSMA protocol under the environment of altering network characteristics like backoff time, number of collisions, number of nodes, etc.

## Input

The system requires the below input. The user can feed values to the system using the spin button integrated into the GUI.

* Number of nodes.
* Number of simulation timeslots.
* Buffer size.
* Frame size.
* Probability of packet generation.
* Re-transmission count.
* Maximum randomization ceiling.
